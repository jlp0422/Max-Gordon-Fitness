          <p>"When I became serious about my health and fitness, there was only one person who I knew could deliver results. Over the past 2 years, Max has helped me transform my body. Through his online programming and nutritional counseling, I learned how to eat, exercise, and train my body the right way. Max was there every step of the way &mdash; always checking in and offering advice. He was happy to answer my questions and provide new ideas that would give me better results; which supplements to take, what to eat, and how to plan my meals were all answered quickly, allowing me to continue my regimen. Many trainers promise results, but only few can deliver like Max."</p>

          <p>"Not only did Max tell me which foods to not include in my diet but he also told me the exact reasons as to why those foods were not optimal for my health and my fitness goals. This knowledge gave me the tools to lose some excess fat and become more lean than I have ever been. He gave me great suggestions and alternatives to some of my favorite foods that aren’t good for someone looking to lose fat and gain muscle. Throughout the few months that I had been under Mr. Gordon’s fitness regimen and nutritional supervision, I have lost body fat and gained lean muscle mass. I am ecstatic with my results. Mr. Gordon is very talented and extremely knowledgeable in his field!"</p>

          <p>"Max is a phenomenal trainer! I have been working with him for over a year now and am incredibly grateful to have found such a positive and energetic person to train with. I started working with Max with the intention of losing the extra weight I gained after college. After losing the intended 25lbs, we switched gears to placing more emphasis on gaining lean muscle mass over weight loss. Max and I went over my diet together and made a few key adjustments to help me along with my new goal. Max approaches each training sessions in a very thoughtful manner, keeping in mind the goals and the mindset of the client, which allows for very enjoyable and efficient training."</p>

          <p>"One of the best decisions I have made was beginning to train with Max. He far exceeded my expectations as a trainer. From form, to nutrition and everything in between he has been there with answers and is always willing to put in the extra time to make sure all my questions are answered and accounted for when I am at school and training online. I am far more confident, not only with myself, but my presence in a gym setting because of Max, and I couldn't be more grateful. Genuine and personable guy."</p>
