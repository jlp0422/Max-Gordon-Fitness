            <h3>How Does Online Training Work?</h3>
              <p>Have your trainer build a customized training plan for you. Bring your workouts to the gym, track your progress. Your trainer reviews your progress and tweaks your training plan. <!-- Sign up and start your fitness journey today. -->Online training takes the guess work out of working out. It allows you to have access to workouts and nutritional protocols that will get you results without the cost of a personal trainer and regardless of location.
              <br><br>
              Month by month, I design fitness programs that meet your needs and get you to where you want to be. I work with clients globally, so no matter where you live, I will help you achieve your fitness goals! I work with clients of all different fitness levels, from those who are complete beginners and have never worked out in their lives, all the way to those who are advanced and just need help getting to the next level. I work with people of all ages, both male and female, and people with all different fitness goals. I have clients who have over 100 pounds to lose, and are here because they need to change their habits in order to save their lives, all the way to clients who are in good shape and looking to be in GREAT shape, or to get ready for their next sports season or power lifting competition. However, programs are made not only for clients who have access to a gym, but also those who workout at home!

            <h3>All Inclusive Online Training and Nutritional Counseling</h3>
              <p>Online training won't do the work for you, but it will show you exactly what to do both in the gym and in the kitchen to reach your goals. Know exactly what sets, reps, weights, and proper form for each exercise, as well as exactly what and how much to eat day-by-day. You are a unique individual with certain exercise and nutrition requirements, so you will be treated as such. Nothing is automated. Each program and workout is designed specifically for you and your needs with your goals in mind. I personally review all the information you send in and create your program using principles that I have seen work time and time again.
